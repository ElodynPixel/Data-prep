Where data will be prepped

# Microsoft fabric
Microsoft fabric can be used to prep data and can assist with the data science process. There is an application for every step in the data science process.

## Common Machine learning models
1. Classification: Predict a categorical value like whether a customer may churn.
2. Regression: Predict a numerical value like the price of a product.
3. Forecasting: Predict future numerical values based on time-series data like the expected sales for the coming month.

## The data science process
1. Define the problem: Together with business users and analysts, decide on what the model should predict and when it's successful.
2. Get the data: Find data sources and get access by storing your data in a Lakehouse.
3. Prepare the data: Explore the data by reading it from a Lakehouse into a notebook. Clean and transform the data based on the model's requirements.
4. Train the model: Choose an algorithm and hyperparameter values based on trial and error by tracking your experiments with MLflow.
5. Generate predictions: Use model batch scoring to generate the requested predictions.

# Summary
Microsoft Fabric offers three key features to help you manage your data science workloads: notebooks, experiments, and models. To train machine learning models that use patterns in large datasets to generate predictions, you can use notebooks. To keep a clear overview of your work and easily compare the models you've trained, you can use experiments. When you've trained a model that you want to use to generate predictions, you can save the model in the workspace.
